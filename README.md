# TCR Diversity Analyzer

This is a Python-based TCR diversity analysis tool that computes the MST-based diversity metrics for T cell repertoires using Smith-Waterman local alignment and BLOSUM-62 substitution matrix. The code constructs an undirected graph with TCR nodes and edge weights corresponding to pairwise Smith-Waterman local alignment scores.
